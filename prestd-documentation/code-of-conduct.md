# Code of Conduct

### Introduction

Welcome to the pREST community! As contributors and maintainers of this open-source project, we are committed to creating a friendly and respectful environment for all participants. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community and the consequences of unacceptable behaviour.

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Expected Behaviour

We expect all contributors and community members to:

* Be respectful and considerate of others.
* Use inclusive language and avoid offensive or derogatory comments.
* Be collaborative and constructive in discussions.
* Show empathy towards other community members.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviours include, but are not limited to:

* Harassment or discrimination based on personal characteristics.
* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, race, religion, or nationality.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including contributors and maintainers, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the project without warning.

### Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour or have any other concerns, please contact a project maintainer or email support@prestdlabs.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces, on project-related social media accounts, and in public spaces when an individual represents pREST or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
