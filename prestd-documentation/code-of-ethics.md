# Code of Ethics

Our Code of Ethics sets the standard for inclusive behaviour, creating a positive environment for contributors and users.

### Inclusivity

pREST embraces contributors and users from all backgrounds, identities, and experiences. Discrimination or exclusion based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or nationality is strictly prohibited.

### Respectful Communication

Prioritizing respectful and constructive communication is essential. Disagreements should be approached with empathy and courtesy. Harassment, insults, or any form of disrespectful behaviour will not be tolerated.

### Collaboration

Collaboration is at the heart of pREST. We encourage contributors to work together, share knowledge, and support each other. By fostering collaboration, we drive innovation and ensure the continued success of our open-source project.

### Open-mindedness

Diverse perspectives and ideas are highly valued. Open-mindedness enables us to consider different approaches, learn from each other, and adapt to new challenges. Constructive feedback is appreciated as we strive for continuous improvement.

### Accountability

All contributors, including maintainers, are held accountable for their actions and decisions. Honesty, transparency, and a commitment to resolving issues responsibly are crucial for maintaining a healthy and accountable community.

### Inclusivity in Documentation and Code

Creating accessible and inclusive documentation and code is a priority. We welcome contributions that enhance the clarity, usability, and inclusivity of our project's documentation and codebase.

### Reporting Violations

Observing behaviour that violates this Code of Ethics? Please report it to the project maintainers. All reports will be treated confidentially, and appropriate actions will be taken to address violations.

### Acknowledgement

This Code of Ethics draws inspiration and adapts principles from various open-source projects committed to fostering positive and inclusive communities.

### Conclusion

By contributing to pREST, you commit to upholding this Code of Ethics. Let's collectively work towards making pREST a positive, collaborative space for everyone.
