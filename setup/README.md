# Get Started

You can follow one of our guides to deploy _**prestd**_ via the technology you prefer:

* [Docker](docker.md) **(Recommended)**
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/prest/prest/tree/main/install-manifests/kubernetes)
* [Heroku Guide](heroku-guide.md)
* Homebrew
* Go language from the [source](https://github.com/prest/prest)
* Binary

The _self-hosted_ version is up to the host to keep prestd up to date, and we invite you to receive all news from prestd via the [**alpha program**, learn more here](https://github.com/prest/prest/discussions/467).
