# Start with Homebrew

### Prerequisites

* macOS
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Create an installation folder called `prestd` where you would like your `prestd` installation and data storage.

**`cd`** (open/join) into the installation folder.

### Quick Start

If none of the above suits you, there's still an option of installing using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/prestd) [![Homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?url=https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula/prestd.json\&query=$.versions.stable\&label=homebrew)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/prestd):

```sh
brew install prestd
```
